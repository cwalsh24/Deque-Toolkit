Group: Code4Days (Isaac Copeland, Connor Walsh, Kyle Byassee)
Date: 10/28/2022

This program is a deque data structure that stores integers. Running the driver runs tests on the deque. 

## How to Run
* Type "make" to compile the program.
* Type ./deque to run the executable created by the compilation process.
* Type "make clean" to remove unwanted files created by the compilation process.
* When the executable is run, the tests are executed and printed automatically. There is no user interaction.
